<!-- How to commit your work for the first time in a new project:
* Initialize a repository: type `git init`. Command line should say "Initialized empty Git repository"
* Check the repository: type `git status`. It should show you the untracked files.
* Save your progress: track the file by adding it using `git add` followed by each of the filenames, one at a time.
* Check what has changed: type `git status`.
* Commit the changes: type `git commit -m "commit message"`
* Success! If you type `git status` You should see "nothing to commit, working directory clean"  -->
